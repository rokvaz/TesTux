# Set-up
Download the latest version of nvm-windows (Node version manager for windows) from [here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
I recommend installing "nvm-setup.exe". After that don't forget to restart your terminal window.

Now download the latest version of node. To do that open a terminal window and type
```nvm install --lts```
After installing you will probably get promted to set installed version as default. To do that type the following
```nvm use 20.11.1```

After this commands npx, npm, node and nvm should be available in your terminal.
